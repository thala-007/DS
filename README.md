1. Implement multi-threaded client/server Process communication using RMI.
2. Develop any distributed application using CORBA to demonstrate object brokering. (Calculator or String operations).
3. Develop a distributed system, to find sum of N elements in an array by distributing N/n elements to n number of processors MPI or OpenMP. Demonstrate by displaying the intermediate sums calculated at different processors.
4. Implement Berkeley algorithm for clock synchronization.
5. Implement token ring based mutual exclusion algorithm.
6. Implement Bully and Ring algorithm for leader election.
